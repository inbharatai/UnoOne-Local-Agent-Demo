## 4. Secrets Scan Result

### Scan 1: API keys / secrets
**Result:** PASS
- No API keys, tokens, passwords, or credentials found.
- Matches were false positives: `tokens.txt` (model file), `KV-cache` (technical term), and references to excluded items in `SECURITY.md`.

### Scan 2: Personal paths
**Result:** PASS
- No `C:\Users\reetu` paths found.

### Scan 3: Email addresses
**Result:** PASS
- No email addresses found.

### Scan 4: Internal URLs / endpoints
**Result:** PASS
- Only public URLs found:
  - `https://www.google.com` (open browser command)
  - `https://api.whatsapp.com/send` (WhatsApp public intent API)
  - `https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx` (open source project)

## 5. Build Status

- **Compilable:** The public repo includes all Gradle modules and dependencies.
- **Stubs noted:** `LocalBrain`, `PromptBuilder`, `ContextRetrievalLayer`, and `AgentRouter` contain clear `// STUB` or `// DEMO` comments.
- **Sherpa-ONNX:** Reflection-safe loading is used so the app compiles without the AAR. Direct JNI calls are commented out and documented.
- **Expected behavior:** UI, rule-based parser, storage, and device actions work. LLM inference returns mock JSON until a real model is loaded.

---

## 6. Known Limitations of Public Demo

1. Local LLM inference is stubbed — returns mock `ToolCall` JSON.
2. Prompt builder is a generic stub — production templates are private.
3. Context retrieval (RAG) is stubbed — no real local or online retrieval.
4. AgentRouter handlers are stubs — full tool implementations are private.
5. Advanced orchestration features (retry logic, multi-step planning, parallel tool execution) are simplified.
